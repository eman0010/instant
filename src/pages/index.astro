      <h2>What is Instant Day?</h2>

      <p>
        October 18 is Instant Day - a day all about celebrating instant
        photography. So get out your Polaroid, Instax or whatever instant
        photography camera you are using, and show us your instants.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instant Day isn’t really a photo competition, it’s more a homage to good
        old analogue, instant photography - everybody who participates are
        winners :-)
      </p>

      <p>But: We do have a nice prize for one lucky instant photographer!</p>

      <h2>Why instant Photography?</h2>
      <p>
        Instant Photography is a testament to life: It all started back in the
        1940’s with a 3 year old kid. She wanted to see her fathers images right
        away. The father, Edwin Land, embarked on a mission: To invent instant
        photography. Half a decade later, Edwin Land launched Instant
        photography and established the Polaroid brand. Instant photography
        turned into big business in the 70’s and 80’s, until the digital era
        almost killed the industry. The massive amount of time wasted on the
        small screens have spurred a counterreaction: Analogue, off-line
        experiences have become popular again. And instant photography is just
        that: An analogue, life-affirming and tactile photography experience. So
        let’s celebrate life, and make memories:-)
